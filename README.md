- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bbottin92
- 👀 I’m interested in making an app that lets you assign a variety of instruments to sounds made with your mouth (and more). Notably, I'd like to incorporate some powerful synthesizers.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything from scratch...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever anyone is interested in ...
- 📫 you can reach me somewhere probably... I'm new at this, do I post my email here?
